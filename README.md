# SignSense

## TIDAL Hackathon Project

SignSense is an innovative AI-powered sign language tutor designed to bridge communication gaps and enhance learning experiences for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. This project aims to leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision technologies to create an interactive and engaging platform for learning sign language.

## Project Overview

SignSense uses a combination of real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition to provide an immersive sign language learning experience. The application can:

* Detect and track hand movements using computer vision
* Recognize and interpret sign language gestures
* Provide real-time feedback and guidance to learners
* Offer interactive lessons and practice sessions

## Features

* Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition
* Customizable learning paths for different skill levels
* Interactive tutorials with visual aids and context
* Progress tracking and performance analytics
* Multi-platform support (desktop and mobile)

## Technologies Used

* Python
* OpenCV for computer vision
* MediaPipe for hand tracking
* TensorFlow/Keras for machine learning (planned)
* Flask for backend API (planned)
* React Native for mobile app development (planned)
